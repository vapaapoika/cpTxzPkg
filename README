cpTxzPkg

DESCRIPTION

An small script which makes a backup of Arch Linux's Pacman's cash

GETTING STARTED

The only thing you need to do is to copy this script (cpTxzPkg.sh) to /usr/bin or any other address that is written on PATH variable and make it executable

USAGE

Just go wherever you want to have the cashes copied (or set it by yourself) and call the script:

cpTxzPkg [/path/to/cash [/path/to/backup/directory]]

Tip: If you want to set the backup directory by yourself (default is where you are), you should set cash's path too. Usually it's /var/cache/pacman/pkg/
